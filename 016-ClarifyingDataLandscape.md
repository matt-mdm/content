# Mapping the Terrain: Clarifying the Data Landscape in a Data Assessment

In the age of the information explosion, understanding your organization's data landscape is crucial. It's like having a map that guides you through the vast terrain of data your organization generates and collects. This terrain is characterized by the volume, velocity, and variety of data - the three Vs. In this post, we'll discuss how to clarify the data landscape as part of a data assessment.

## Clarifying the Data Landscape

1. **Identify Data Sources**: Start by identifying where your data comes from. A data source is the origin of your data. This could be internal sources like databases and CRM systems, or external sources like social media and third-party APIs. 

   **Template Example**:

   | Data Source | Type of Data | Data Owner | Data Users |
   |-------------|--------------|------------|------------|
   | CRM System  | Customer Data| Sales Dept.| Marketing Dept.|

2. **Understand Data Flow**: Next, understand how data flows through your organization. This includes how data is collected, processed, stored, and used. You can collect existing visual data flow documentation or create a simple table. For instance, customer data might be collected through a CRM system, processed to remove duplicates and validate entries, stored in a central database, and finally used for sales analysis and marketing campaigns.

   **Template Example**:

   | Data Source | Process | Storage | End Use |
   |-------------|---------|---------|---------|
   | CRM System  | Collection, Deduplication, Validation | Central Database | Sales Analysis, Marketing Campaigns |

3. **Catalog Data Assets**: Catalog your data assets. A data asset, also known as an entity or a logical group of entities, is a piece of data or a group of data that has value to the organization. This includes not just the data itself, but also the systems, tools, and processes used to manage it. As part of your cataloging, it's important to understand the volume (how much data), velocity (how fast data is generated and processed), and variety (different types of data) of your data assets.

   **Template Example**:

   | Data Asset | Description | Volume | Velocity | Variety | Location | Owner | Users |
   |------------|-------------|--------|----------|---------|----------|-------|-------|
   | Customer Database | Contains customer contact and purchase history | 10,000 records | 100 new records/day | Structured data | CRM System | Sales Dept. | Marketing Dept. |

4. **Assess Data Quality**: Assess the quality of your data. This involves looking at factors like accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, and relevance.

   **Template Example**:

   | Data Asset | Accuracy | Completeness | Consistency | Timeliness | Relevance |
   |------------|----------|--------------|-------------|------------|-----------|
   | Customer Database | High | Medium | High | High | High |

5. **Identify Data Challenges**: Identify any challenges or issues with your data. This could be things like data silos, data quality issues, or lack of data governance.

   **Template Example**:

   | Data Challenge | Impact | Potential Solution |
   |----------------|--------|--------------------|
   | Data Silos | Inefficiency, lack of single source of truth | Implement a data integration solution |

## Clarifying Questions for Stakeholders

1. "What are the main sources of data in our organization?"
2. "How does data flow through our organization?"
3. "What are our key data assets and how are they managed?"
4. "What is the quality of our data like?"
5. "What challenges or issues are we facing with our data?"

## Conclusion

Clarifying the data landscape is a crucial part of a data assessment. By identifying data sources, understanding data flow, cataloging data assets, assessing data quality, and identifying data challenges, you can gain a comprehensive understanding of your organization's data landscape.
