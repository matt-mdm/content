# Steering the Ship: Defining Data Governance Goals for Master Data Management

Master Data Management (MDM) is a critical component of an organization's data strategy. It ensures the consistency, accuracy, and control of critical business data. However, the success of an MDM initiative largely depends on the clarity of its data governance goals. In this post, we'll discuss how to work with business stakeholders to elicit requirements and identify appropriate data governance goals for your MDM initiative.

## The Importance of Data Governance Goals

Data governance is the overall management of the availability, usability, integrity, and security of the data employed in an enterprise. It's a set of processes that ensures that important data assets are formally managed throughout the enterprise. Data governance ensures that data can be trusted and that people can be made accountable for any adverse event that happens because of low data quality. It is about putting people in charge of fixing and preventing issues with data so that the enterprise can become more efficient.

## Working with Stakeholders

Business stakeholders play a crucial role in defining data governance goals. They are the ones who understand the business needs, use the data on a daily basis, and are familiar with the business processes that the data supports. Therefore, their input is invaluable in defining the data governance goals for the MDM initiative.

Here are some steps to effectively work with stakeholders:

1. **Identify Stakeholders**: Start by identifying who your stakeholders are. These could be business users, data owners, IT staff, executives, or anyone else who has a stake in the MDM initiative.

2. **Secure Management Sponsorship**: Data governance initiatives need to be business-led and require an appropriate level of management sponsorship. This means securing buy-in from top management and ensuring they understand the importance of data governance. This sponsorship is crucial for providing the necessary resources and authority to implement data governance effectively.

3. **Establish a Data Governance Council**: This council should be composed of representatives from different business units who have a stake in the MDM initiative. The council will be responsible for setting data governance goals, making decisions, and resolving any issues that arise.

4. **Understand Business Processes**: Understanding the business processes that rely on master data is key to defining your data governance goals. This involves working with stakeholders to map out these processes and identify where and how master data is used. This understanding can help guide the choice of data governance goals and inform other decisions about the MDM initiative.

5. **Conduct Interviews and Workshops**: Conduct interviews and workshops with stakeholders to understand their needs, expectations, and concerns. Use these sessions to gather information about their data needs, business processes, and any challenges they face with the current data management practices.

6. **Document and Validate Data Governance Goals**: Document the data governance goals gathered from the stakeholders and validate them to ensure they accurately represent the stakeholders' needs. This could involve reviewing the goals with the stakeholders and making any necessary revisions.

## Defining Data Governance Goals

Data governance goals typically focus on several key areas, including:

1. **Data Quality**: Ensuring the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of data.

2. **Data Security**: Protecting data from unauthorized access and ensuring compliance with relevant regulations.

3. **Data Privacy**: Ensuring that personal data is handled in accordance with privacy laws and regulations.

4. **Data Lifecycle Management**: Managing the flow of data throughout its lifecycle, from creation and initial storage to the time when it becomes obsolete and is deleted.

5. **Data Policies and Procedures**: Establishing policies and procedures for data management, and ensuring they are followed.

The specific data governance goals will depend on the needs of the business and the requirements of the stakeholders. For example, if data security is a top priority for your stakeholders, one of your data governance goals might be

to implement robust data access controls and monitoring systems.

## Conclusion

Defining clear data governance goals is a crucial step in any MDM initiative. These goals provide direction, align your team, motivate your employees, and allow you to measure your success. By working closely with stakeholders, securing management sponsorship, establishing a data governance council, understanding business processes, and conducting interviews and workshops, you can define data governance goals that will guide your MDM initiative towards success and help your organization unlock the full value of its data. Remember, data governance is a business-led initiative and requires the active participation and support of management to be truly effective.
