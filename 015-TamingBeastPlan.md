# Taming the Beast: Planning for a Data Assessment in the Age of Information Explosion

In today's digital age, organizations are dealing with an "Information Explosion". The sheer volume of data being generated and collected is overwhelming, and it's becoming increasingly difficult to manage. However, before embarking on a data management initiative, it's crucial to conduct a data assessment. This is often the first step a data professional may take when an organization faces a data challenge. In this post, we'll discuss how to plan for a data assessment.

### Planning for a Data Assessment

1. **Identify Stakeholders**: The first step in planning for a data assessment is to identify the stakeholders. These are the individuals or groups who have a vested interest in the data and will be affected by changes to it.

2. **Understand the Information Explosion**: Once the stakeholders are identified, the next step is to understand the nature of the information explosion. This involves understanding the volume, velocity, and variety of data being generated and collected, and the challenges it presents.

3. **Ask Clarifying Questions**: Asking clarifying questions can help to better understand the data challenge. Some questions might include: What data is being generated? How is the data currently managed? What are the consequences of the information explosion? What is the desired state of data management?

4. **Collect Relevant Information**: Collecting relevant information is a crucial part of the data assessment. This might include data samples, data dictionaries, data flow diagrams, and any existing documentation about the data and data management processes.

5. **Assess Data Management Processes**: Once the relevant information is collected, assess the current data management processes. This involves examining how data is collected, stored, processed, and used, and identifying any gaps or inefficiencies.

6. **Identify Potential Technical Solutions**: Based on the assessment of data management processes, identify potential technical solutions. This might involve considering different data management technologies, tools, or platforms that could help manage the information explosion.

### Conclusion

Planning for a data assessment is a crucial first step in addressing the information explosion. By identifying stakeholders, understanding the information explosion, asking clarifying questions, collecting relevant information, assessing data management processes, and identifying potential technical solutions, you can ensure that your data assessment is thorough and effective.
