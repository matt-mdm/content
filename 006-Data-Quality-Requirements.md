# Setting the Bar: Defining Data Quality Goals for Master Data Management

Master Data Management (MDM) is a critical component of an organization's data strategy. It ensures the consistency, accuracy, and control of critical business data. However, the success of an MDM initiative largely depends on the clarity of its data quality goals. In this post, we'll discuss how to work with business stakeholders to elicit requirements, conduct data profiling, and identify appropriate data quality goals for your MDM initiative.

## The Importance of Data Quality Goals

Data quality goals are the standards that your master data must meet to serve the needs of the business. They define what "good" data looks like and set the bar for data quality within your organization. Without clear data quality goals, your MDM initiative lacks direction and purpose, and the value of your master data may be compromised.

## Working with Stakeholders

Business stakeholders play a crucial role in defining data quality goals. They are the ones who understand the business needs, use the data on a daily basis, and are familiar with the business processes that the data supports. Therefore, their input is invaluable in defining the data quality goals for the MDM initiative.

Here are some steps to effectively work with stakeholders:

1. **Identify Stakeholders**: Start by identifying who your stakeholders are. These could be business users, data owners, IT staff, executives, or anyone else who has a stake in the MDM initiative.

2. **Understand Business Processes**: Understanding the business processes that rely on master data is key to defining your data quality goals. This involves working with stakeholders to map out these processes and identify where and how master data is used. This understanding can help guide the choice of data quality goals and inform other decisions about the MDM initiative.

3. **Conduct Data Profiling**: Data profiling is the process of examining the data available in an existing database and collecting statistics and information about that data. This step is crucial to understand the current state of data quality and identify areas that need improvement. Tools can be used to automate much of this process, providing insights into data accuracy, completeness, consistency, and more.

4. **Conduct Interviews and Workshops**: Conduct interviews and workshops with stakeholders to understand their needs, expectations, and concerns. Use these sessions to gather information about their data needs, business processes, and any challenges they face with the current data management practices.

5. **Document and Validate Data Quality Goals**: Document the data quality goals gathered from the stakeholders and validate them to ensure they accurately represent the stakeholders' needs. This could involve reviewing the goals with the stakeholders and making any necessary revisions.

## Defining Data Quality Goals

Data quality goals typically focus on several key dimensions of data quality, including:

1. **Accuracy**: The data should be correct and reliable.

2. **Completeness**: All required data fields should be filled in.

3. **Consistency**: The same data should be the same across all systems.

4. **Timeliness**: The data should be up-to-date and available when needed.

5. **Uniqueness**: Each data entity should be represented only once.

The specific data quality goals will depend on the needs of the business and the requirements of the stakeholders. For example, if accuracy is a top priority for your stakeholders, one of your data quality goals might be to reduce data errors by a certain percentage within a specified timeframe.

## Conclusion

Defining clear data quality goals is a crucial step in any MDM initiative. These goals provide direction, align your team, motivate your employees, and allow you to measure your success. By working closely with stakeholders, understanding their needs and business processes, and conducting data profiling, you can define data quality goals that will guide your MDM initiative towards success and help your organization

unlock the full value of its data. Understanding the current state of your data through data profiling also provides a benchmark against which you can measure the progress of your MDM initiative, and helps identify the areas that need the most attention. This comprehensive approach ensures that your data quality goals are not only well-defined, but also achievable and aligned with the real-world needs of your business.
